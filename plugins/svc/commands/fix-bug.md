description: "Targeted bug-fix pipeline. Runs coder → tester in a tight loop until the bug is resolved. Usage: /svc:fix-bug <bug description or error message>"
---

You are the **orchestrator** in bug-fix mode. No planning or deployment phases — focus on fixing and verifying.

**Bug report:** $ARGUMENTS

---

## Phase 0 — Prelude

Run the prelude:

1. `git status --porcelain` — stop if dirty.
2. `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` → record `$WORK_BRANCH`.
3. If on `main`: derive a `fix/<slug>` slug (lowercase, hyphens, ≤40 chars). Then `git checkout -b fix/<slug>` and update `$WORK_BRANCH`.
4. `BASE_REF=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`.
5. Build `<project-map>` (output of `ls -d */` excluding `.devbox`, `.venv`, `.git`, `node_modules`). Hold as `$PROJECT_MAP`. Prepend to each subagent prompt below.

Print `## Phase 0 — on $WORK_BRANCH, BASE_REF=<short-sha>`.

**Shape dispatch.** After the prelude, run `cplat shape`. It prints JSON: `shape`, `plugin`, `deployable`, `library` and `agents` (the subagent type for every role — spawn each role with exactly that type, e.g. `agents.coder`). If `unsupported` is present, stop and show it. Roles missing from `agents` (e.g. deployment for a library) are skipped. Print `Shape: <shape>`.

---

**Bug or spec change?** A bug is code that does not do what was intended. If the "bug" is behaviour an active spec criterion explicitly states (the spec says so, the user wants it different), it is a spec change: stop and recommend `/svc:spec --amend <NNN> <change>`.

---

## Step 1 — Diagnose and fix

Use the **coder** agent. Prompt prelude: the `<project-map>` block. Then:
> "Bug report: `$ARGUMENTS`.
>
> Step 1: read the relevant files and identify the root cause. State the root cause and the minimal change you intend to make in 2-3 lines before editing.
>
> Step 2: apply the minimal fix. Do not refactor surrounding code or add unrelated changes.
>
> Step 3: report what you changed (files + 1-line summary per file) and the root cause you found."

After the coder finishes, capture:
```bash
TOUCHED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only $BASE_REF -- .)
```

---

## Step 2 — Verify

Use the **tester** agent. Prompt prelude:
```
<project-map>
$PROJECT_MAP
</project-map>
<touched-files>
$TOUCHED_FILES
</touched-files>
```

Then:
- Run the existing test suite via `devbox run test-fast`
- Write a regression test that would have caught this bug (anchor it on the files in `<touched-files>`). If the broken behaviour is stated by a spec criterion (`docs/specs/*/spec.md`, `AC-<NNN>.<n>`), name that id in the test so `cplat spec trace` links it; never edit an existing acceptance test to make it pass
- Confirm the bug is resolved

---

## Step 3 — Loop if needed

If the tester reports the bug is NOT fixed:
- Feed the failure back to the **coder** (with `<project-map>` + refreshed `<touched-files>`)
- Re-run the **tester**
- Repeat up to 3 times. If still unresolved, stop and report with full context.

---

## Phase 4 — Commit and open PR

After the tester confirms the bug is resolved:

1. Check for uncommitted changes (`git status --porcelain`). If non-empty, commit with a conventional commit message:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix(<scope>): <imperative description of the fix>"
   ```

2. Push the branch (pre-approved for `fix/*` branches):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <current-branch>
   ```

3. Create the PR (requires user confirmation — `gh pr create` is in the `ask` list):
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --title "fix(<scope>): <same description as the commit>" \
     --fill-verbose
   ```

4. Print the PR URL.

**If Phase 0 found we were already on `main`:** warn "Skipping PR creation — working directly on main." and skip Phase 4.

## Final Report

```
## Bug fix complete (or: escalating to user)

**Bug:** $ARGUMENTS
**Branch:** <branch-name>
**Root cause:** <one line>
**Fix:** <files changed, what changed>
**Regression test:** <test file and test name>
**Test result:** N passed
**PR:** <URL> (CI running)
```

> If a step fails because a platform template, script or command misbehaves (not because of the user's code), stop, summarize it in two lines and offer `/shared:report-issue` so the user can file it. Never file anything without their OK.
