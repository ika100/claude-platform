An **addon** is declared once in `app.yaml` and used by name. Services see a **contract** (a Secret and environment variables), never the implementation.

| Addon | Declare | Services get | Implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `addons: {postgres: {version: 17, instances: {dev: 1, prod: 3}}}` and `uses: [postgres]` on a service | `DATABASE_URL`, `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD` from the operator's Secret | CloudNativePG `Cluster` per environment |
| `observability` | `addons: {observability: {ui: lgtm}}` (no `uses` needed) | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` and friends | an OpenTelemetry Collector per environment that receives OTLP and scrapes each service's Prometheus path; backend is `ui: lgtm` (local Grafana, dev only) or your own `exportTo` endpoint |

A Spring Boot service generated with `--data needs_database=true` is already wired to these variables (JPA, Flyway, Testcontainers tests, `devbox run db-up` for local development).

Operators are cluster prerequisites: `cluster-up` installs them locally; real clusters need them installed by the cluster owner. Removing an addon never deletes a database (its Argo Application is not pruned).

Because the contract is stable, an implementation can be swapped without touching any service ([ADR-020](/sdlc-foundry/reference/adr/020/), [ADR-021](/sdlc-foundry/reference/adr/021/)). Try it: [Add Postgres, secrets and observability](/sdlc-foundry/scenarios/addons-secrets-observability/).
