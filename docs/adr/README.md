# Architecture decision records

Decisions that shape how the platform works, with the context and the alternatives that were rejected. Every ADR has a status line; superseded decisions keep their file and say which ADR replaced them.

**Adding one:** copy the structure of a recent ADR (context, decision, consequences, what is not included), use the next free number, and list it in the table below (`scripts/shapes.py check` fails when an ADR file is missing here).
